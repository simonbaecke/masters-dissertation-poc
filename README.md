# Proof of Concept Application
This tool is a proof of concept application of the master's dissertation "Data-based compliance checking against building requirements". It presents a methodology for Automatic Compliance Checking and Decision-Making with the use of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). An example diagram and database are attached to illustrate the capabilities of the tool, but it is possible to upload other BPMN XML diagrams and their associated JSON databases to check compliance.

## Installation
To run the tool, simply download the zip folder and extract the content or clone the repository in a terminal.
```
 git clone https://github.com/simonbaecke/masters-dissertation-poc.git
 ```
 When this is done the app.py file has to be executed, which can also be done in the terminal.
```
python app.py
 ```
## Use
You can upload a BPMN diagram and a corresponding JSON database or you can select the example files at the 'Example Rainwater Regulation' page.
